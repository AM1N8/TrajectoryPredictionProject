# Trajectory Prediction using Point Clouds and Sensor Data
## Technical Documentation

### 1. Introduction

This document presents a comprehensive approach to autonomous vehicle trajectory prediction using multimodal sensor fusion. The system combines sequential vehicle dynamics data with LiDAR point cloud information to predict future vehicle trajectories. The methodology employs deep learning architectures specifically designed for spatiotemporal data fusion, addressing the critical challenge of accurate motion prediction in autonomous driving scenarios.

### 2. Problem Formulation

The trajectory prediction problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence learning task where we predict future vehicle displacements based on historical vehicle states and environmental perception data.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Given a sequence of historical vehicle states:
```
X_seq = {x₁, x₂, ..., x_T}
```

And corresponding LiDAR point cloud data:
```
P = {p₁, p₂, ..., p_N} where p_i ∈ ℝ⁴ (x, y, z, intensity)
```

The objective is to predict future relative displacements:
```
Y = {Δx₁, Δx₂, ..., Δx_H} where Δx_i = (δx_i, δy_i)
```

Where T is the sequence length, N is the number of LiDAR points, and H is the prediction horizon.

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline

#### 3.1 Vehicle Dynamics Feature Engineering

The system calculates enhanced vehicle dynamics features from raw sensor data:

**Speed Calculation:**
```
v(t) = √(v_x²(t) + v_y²(t))
```

**Heading Estimation:**
```
θ(t) = arctan2(v_y(t), v_x(t))
```

**Acceleration Components:**
```
a_x(t) = dv_x/dt, a_y(t) = dv_y/dt
a(t) = √(a_x²(t) + a_y²(t))
```

**Jerk Calculation:**
```
j_x(t) = da_x/dt, j_y(t) = da_y/dt
j(t) = √(j_x²(t) + j_y²(t))
```

**Curvature Estimation:**
```
κ(t) = (dθ/dt)/(v(t) + ε)
```

Where ε is a small constant to prevent division by zero.

#### 3.2 Point Cloud Processing

The LiDAR data undergoes sophisticated preprocessing to ensure consistent representation:

**Weighted Sampling Strategy:**
Point clouds are sampled using distance-based weighting to prioritize closer, more relevant points:
```
w_i = 1/(d_i + 0.1) where d_i = √(x_i² + y_i²)
P(p_i) = w_i/∑w_j
```

**Robust Normalization:**
Points are normalized using percentile-based scaling for outlier resistance:
```
x_norm = (x - median(X))/percentile_90(||x||)
```

### 4. Model Architecture

#### 4.1 Point Cloud Encoder (PointNet-Inspired)

The point cloud encoder processes unordered 3D point sets using permutation-invariant operations:

**Point-wise Convolutions:**
Each point is processed independently through 1D convolutions:
```
f_i^(l+1) = σ(W^(l) · f_i^(l) + b^(l))
```

**Global Feature Aggregation:**
Features are aggregated using both max and average pooling:
```
g_global = [max_pooling(F), avg_pooling(F)]
```

This approach ensures the network learns both the most prominent features (max pooling) and the general distribution (average pooling) of the point cloud.

#### 4.2 Sequence Encoder with Attention

The sequence encoder employs bidirectional LSTM layers with self-attention mechanism:

**Bidirectional LSTM:**
```
h_t^→ = LSTM^→(x_t, h_{t-1}^→)
h_t^← = LSTM^←(x_t, h_{t+1}^←)
h_t = [h_t^→; h_t^←]
```

**Self-Attention Mechanism:**
The attention weights are computed as:
```
e_t = W_a · h_t + b_a
α_t = softmax(e_t)
c = Σ(α_t · h_t)
```

This allows the model to focus on the most relevant historical timesteps for prediction.

#### 4.3 Fusion Architecture

The multimodal fusion combines point cloud and sequence features:
```
f_combined = [f_sequence; f_pointcloud]
```

The combined features are processed through fully connected layers with batch normalization and dropout for regularization.

### 5. Loss Function Design

#### 5.1 Weighted Displacement Loss

A custom loss function addresses the varying importance of prediction accuracy across different time horizons:

```
L(y_true, y_pred) = (1/T) Σ_{t=1}^T w_t · √((Δx_true^t - Δx_pred^t)² + (Δy_true^t - Δy_pred^t)²)
```

**Temporal Weighting:**
```
w_t = 1/√t normalized such that Σw_t = 1
```

This weighting scheme prioritizes accuracy in near-term predictions while maintaining awareness of long-term trajectory coherence.

#### 5.2 Loss Function Rationale

The weighted approach addresses several key challenges:
- **Temporal Uncertainty:** Prediction confidence naturally decreases with time horizon
- **Error Propagation:** Early prediction errors compound in trajectory estimation
- **Training Stability:** Balanced weighting prevents the model from ignoring difficult long-term predictions

### 6. Evaluation Metrics

#### 6.1 Displacement Error Metrics

**Mean Displacement Error (MDE):**
```
MDE = (1/N) Σ_{i=1}^N √((x_true^i - x_pred^i)² + (y_true^i - y_pred^i)²)
```

**Final Displacement Error (FDE):**
```
FDE = (1/N) Σ_{i=1}^N √((x_true^{final,i} - x_pred^{final,i})² + (y_true^{final,i} - y_pred^{final,i})²)
```

#### 6.2 Path Quality Metrics

**Path Smoothness:**
Quantifies trajectory realism by measuring angular changes:
```
Smoothness = (1/N) Σ_{i=1}^N (1/(M-2)) Σ_{j=2}^{M-1} arccos((v_{j-1} · v_j)/(||v_{j-1}|| · ||v_j||))
```

Where v_j represents the vector between consecutive waypoints.

#### 6.3 Speed-Stratified Analysis

Performance is evaluated across different speed regimes to understand model behavior:
- Low speed (< 5 m/s): Urban driving scenarios
- Medium speed (5-20 m/s): Suburban environments  
- High speed (> 20 m/s): Highway conditions

### 7. Coordinate System and Transformations

#### 7.1 Relative Displacement Representation

The system employs relative displacement representation to improve learning stability:

**Advantages:**
- **Translation Invariance:** Model learns motion patterns independent of absolute position
- **Numerical Stability:** Smaller magnitude values improve gradient flow
- **Generalization:** Patterns learned in one location transfer to others

**Transformation:**
```
Δx_t = x_t - x_{t-1}
Δy_t = y_t - y_{t-1}
```

**Reconstruction:**
```
x_t = x_0 + Σ_{i=1}^t Δx_i
y_t = y_0 + Σ_{i=1}^t Δy_i
```

#### 7.2 Coordinate Frame Considerations

The system operates in the vehicle's local coordinate frame, where:
- X-axis: Forward direction
- Y-axis: Lateral direction (positive left)
- Origin: Vehicle center of mass

This choice simplifies the learning problem by maintaining consistent reference frames across different driving scenarios.
